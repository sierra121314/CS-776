## Homework 2
#### Problem Statement:
* Use a HillClimber to maximize the function double eval(int *vec).  EvalCPP and EvalCPP1 are two black box functions, try to maximize both.

To compile the program, please enter the following:
```
g++ -o solver main.cpp evalCPP.o -std=c++11
```

  *OR*
               
```
g++ -o solver main.cpp evalCPP1.o -std=c++11
```

To run the program:
```
./solver
```

#### To Graph Use Matlab with the HW2_data.m File
